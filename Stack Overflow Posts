    the procedure entry point __gxx_personality_v0 could not be located in the 
    dynamic link library

When I had this linker error via `#include <vector>`, I copied the `libstdc++-6.dll` file from `MinGW\bin`  to `Windows\SysWOW64`, because copying the file to `WINDOWS\System32` did not work. I suspect this specific error is caused by a windows system bit version mismatch between IDE Codelite and compiler MinGW. I should have installed [`MinGW-w64`](https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php "x64 Version Project Page") and set it as the path in the IDE, but I have `mingw32` on my OS(C:) drive instead.

========================================================================================================

My Code in Codelite

    #include <iostream>
    #include <vector>

    using namespace std;

    int main() {
    	vector <char> vowels {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'};
	
    	cout << vowels[0] << endl;
    	cout << vowels[4] << endl;

        return 0;
    }

Compiler Error using MinGW from [MinGW](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/downloads/68260/mingw-get-setup.exe/ "Installation Manager Setup Tool Download")


    The procedure entry point __gxx_personality_v0 could not be 
    located in the dynamic link library.

I had the above linker error when using `#include <vector>` while following the Udemy [Beginning C++ Programming](https://www.udemy.com/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/ "Course Store Page") course. 

`A Solution:`

I copied the `libstdc++-6.dll` file from `MinGW\bin`  to `Windows\SysWOW64`, because copying the file to `WINDOWS\System32` did not work.

I found this potential solution in the answers to a question about make.exe in the bin folder of MinGW, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18668003/the-procedure-entry-point-gxx-personality-v0-could-not-be-located/53822389?noredirect=1#comment94495915_53822389 "'the procedure entry point __gxx_personality_v0 could not be located' Thread"). Is this specific error caused by a windows system bit version mismatch between IDE Codelite and compiler MinGW, and are there better solutions?

I suspect I should have installed [`MinGW-w64`](https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php "x64 Version Project Page"), and set it as the path in the IDE, but I have `mingw32` on my OS(C:) drive instead.
