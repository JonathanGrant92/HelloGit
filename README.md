# hello-world
#### Hello Github

I know some Python and Octave from college courses such as physics and intro to programming.
My favorite programming language is Python so far, but my favorite subject is math.
My long-term goal is a bachelors of science in mathematics. Along the way, I plan to learn as much about programming as I can, because math and programming are complementary.

Currently, I'm learning how to code with freecodecamp.org!
I am almost done with the FCC Responsive Web Design Certification. I am currently working through the projects using codepen.io.
