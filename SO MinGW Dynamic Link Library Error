    the procedure entry point __gxx_personality_v0 could not be located in the 
    dynamic link library

When I had this linker error via `#include <vector>`, I copied the `libstdc++-6.dll` file from `MinGW\bin`  to `Windows\SysWOW64`, because copying the file to `WINDOWS\System32` did not work. I suspect this specific error is caused by a windows system bit version mismatch between IDE Codelite and compiler MinGW. I should have installed [`MinGW-w64`](https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php "x64 Version Project Page") and set it as the path in the IDE, but I have `mingw32` on my OS(C:) drive instead.

========================================================================================================

My Code in Codelite

    #include <iostream>
    #include <vector>

    using namespace std;

    int main() {
    	vector <char> vowels {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'};
	
    	cout << vowels[0] << endl;
    	cout << vowels[4] << endl;

        return 0;
    }

    The procedure entry point __gxx_personality_v0 could not be 
    located in the dynamic link library.

I had the above linker error when using `#include <vector>` while following the Udemy [Beginning C++ Programming](https://www.udemy.com/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/ "Course Store Page") course. 

`A Solution:`

I copied the `libstdc++-6.dll` file from `MinGW\bin`  to `Windows\SysWOW64`, because copying the file to `WINDOWS\System32` did not work.

I found this potential solution in the answers to a question about make.exe in the bin folder of MinGW, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18668003/the-procedure-entry-point-gxx-personality-v0-could-not-be-located/53822389?noredirect=1#comment94495915_53822389 "'the procedure entry point __gxx_personality_v0 could not be located' Thread"). Is this specific error caused by a windows system bit version mismatch between IDE Codelite and compiler MinGW, and are there better solutions?

#A Prospective Solution:

###I copied the `libstdc++-6.dll` file from `MinGW\bin`  to `Windows\SysWOW64` after copying the file to `WINDOWS\System32` did not work.

I found this potential solution in the answers to a question about make.exe in the bin folder of MinGW, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18668003/the-procedure-entry-point-gxx-personality-v0-could-not-be-located/53822389?noredirect=1#comment94495915_53822389 "'the procedure entry point __gxx_personality_v0 could not be located' Thread").

#A Followup Question:

###Is this specific error caused by a windows system bit version mismatch between IDE Codelite and compiler MinGW, and are there other solutions?

I suspect I should have installed [`MinGW-w64`](https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php "x64 Version Project Page"), and set it as the path in the IDE, but instead, I have the path set to `mingw32` on my OS(C:) drive.

*This was the best question thread I could find after reading through dozens of threads. I know  I'm confident that my answer helps resolve the question we have, but there are likely better solutions.*

"procedure entry point could not be located in the dynamic link library" execution error using #include with compiler MinGW & IDE CodeLite

My Code in Codelite

    The procedure entry point __gxx_personality_v0 could not be 
    located in the dynamic link library

The above error triggering during execution of the file in a CLI error popup window when using `#include <vector>`, while following the Udemy [Beginning C++ Programming](https://www.udemy.com/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/ "Course Store Page") course. 

#A Prospective Solution:

###I copied the `libstdc++-6.dll` file from `MinGW\bin`  to `Windows\SysWOW64` after copying the file to `WINDOWS\System32` did not work.

I realized this possible solution from a similar one in the answers to a question about make.exe in the bin folder of MinGW, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18668003/the-procedure-entry-point-gxx-personality-v0-could-not-be-located/53822389?noredirect=1#comment94495915_53822389 "'the procedure entry point __gxx_personality_v0 could not be located' Thread").

#The Question:

###Is this specific error caused by a windows system bit version mismatch between IDE Codelite and compiler MinGW, and is there a more comprehensive solution?

I suspect I should have installed [`MinGW-w64`](https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php "x64 Version Project Page"), and set it as the path in the IDE, but instead, I have the path set to the MinGW 32 bit version, which is installed on my OS(C:) drive.

*I could not find an existing thread suitable to resolving this error after reading through dozens of threads with similar problems, but using different development environments, libraries or compilers, and providing solutions irrelevant to this scenario.*
