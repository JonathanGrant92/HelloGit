Title-
"procedure entry point could not be located in the dynamic link library" execution error using #include with compiler MinGW & IDE CodeLite

Post-
My Code in Codelite

    #include <iostream>
    #include <vector>

    using namespace std;

    int main() {
    	vector <char> vowels {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'};
	
    	cout << vowels[0] << endl;
    	cout << vowels[4] << endl;

        return 0;
    }

Post-Build Error using MinGW from [MinGW](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/downloads/68260/mingw-get-setup.exe/ "Installation Manager Setup Tool Download")

    The procedure entry point __gxx_personality_v0 could not be 
    located in the dynamic link library

The above error triggered during the execution of the `main.cpp` file in a CLI error popup window when using `#include <vector>`, while following the Udemy [Beginning C++ Programming](https://www.udemy.com/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/ "Course Store Page") course. 

#A Prospective Solution:

###I copied the `libstdc++-6.dll` file from `MinGW\bin`  to `Windows\SysWOW64` after copying the file to `WINDOWS\System32` did not work.

I realized this possible solution from a similar one in the answers to a question about make.exe in the bin folder of MinGW, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18668003/the-procedure-entry-point-gxx-personality-v0-could-not-be-located/53822389?noredirect=1#comment94495915_53822389 "'the procedure entry point __gxx_personality_v0 could not be located' Thread").

#The Question:

###Is this specific error caused by a windows system bit version mismatch between IDE Codelite and compiler MinGW, and is there a more comprehensive solution?

I suspect I should have installed [`MinGW-w64`](https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php "x64 Version Project Page"), and set it as the path in the IDE, but instead, I have the path set to the MinGW 32 bit version, which is installed on my OS(C:) drive.

*I could not find an existing thread suitable to resolving this error after reading through dozens of threads with similar problems, but using different development environments, libraries or compilers, and providing answers and solutions irrelevant to this scenario.*
